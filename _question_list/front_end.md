questions:
- question: "What's the difference between an expression and a statement?"
  answer: "In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators."
  - question: "How many types of expressions are in the following statement: a = b * 2;?"
  answer: "2 is a literal value expression. b is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value. b * 2 is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication. a = b * 2 is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of the b * 2 expression to the variable a (more on assignments later)."
  - question: "How often and when is JavaScript compiled?"
    answer: "It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code."
