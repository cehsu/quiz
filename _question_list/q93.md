This is a trick question. The answer is never. I’ve been issuing this challenge for years, and the only answers I’ve ever heard fall into one of [several common misconceptions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/common-misconceptions-about-inheritance-in-javascript-d5d9bab29b0a). More frequently, the challenge is met with silence.

Good to hear:
-Rarely, almost never, or never.
-“Favor object composition over class inheritance.”

Red flags:
-Any other response.
-“React Components” — no, the pitfalls of class inheritance don’t change just because a new framework comes along and embraces the `class` keyword. Contrary to popular awareness, you don’t need to use `class` to use React. This answer reveals a misunderstanding of both `class` and React.
