Answer: You can use the following methods in `document`

`getElementById` to get a element that has the provided Id.
`getElementsByClassName` to get a nodelist (nodelist is not an array, rather it is array-like object) by providing a class name.
`getElementsByTagName` to get a nodelist by the provided tag name.
`querySelector` you will pass css style selector (jquery style) and this will retrurn first matched element in the DOM.
`querySelectorAll` will return a non-live nodelist by using depth-first pre order traversal of all the matched elements. Non-live means, any changes after selecting the elements will not be reflected.
There are two more options but I dont use them frequently-

`getElementsByName` returns the list of elements by the provided name of the html tag
`getElementsByTagNameNS` returns elements with particular tag name within the provided namespace
