There is more than one type of prototypal inheritance:

-Delegation (i.e., the prototype chain).
-Concatenative (i.e. mixins, `Object.assign()`).
-Functional (Not to be confused with functional programming. A function used to create a closure for private state/encapsulation).

Each type of prototypal inheritance has its own set of use-cases, but all of them are equally useful in their ability to enable composition, which creates has-a or uses-a or can-do relationships as opposed to the is-a relationship created with class inheritance.

Good to hear:
-In situations where modules or functional programming don’t provide an obvious solution.
-When you need to compose objects from multiple sources.
-Any time you need inheritance.

Red flags:
-No knowledge of when to use prototypes.
-No awareness of mixins or `Object.assign()`.
