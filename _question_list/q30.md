Answer: You can use clear: both in an empty div `<div style="clear: both;"></div>`, you can use overflow hidden or scroll and you can float the parent as well.

What the heck? Sorry. if you didn't get the question or answer, please read "Techniques for clearing floats" in [css-tricks: all about floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)
