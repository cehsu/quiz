This is a quote from [“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612). It means that code reuse should be achieved by assembling smaller units of functionality into new objects instead of inheriting from classes and creating object taxonomies.

In other words, use can-do, has-a, or uses-a relationships instead of is-a relationships.

Good to hear:
-Avoid class hierarchies.
-Avoid brittle base class problem.
-Avoid tight coupling.
-Avoid rigid taxonomy (forced is-a relationships that are eventually wrong for new use cases).
-Avoid the gorilla banana problem (“what you wanted was a banana, what you got was a gorilla holding the banana, and the entire jungle”).
-Make code more flexible.

Red Flags:
-Fail to mention any of the problems above.
-Fail to articulate the difference between composition and class inheritance, or the advantages of composition.
