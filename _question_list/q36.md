Answer: Technically, height, width, padding and border are part of box model and margin is related to it.

Extra: Everything in a web page is a box where you can control size, position, background, etc. Each box/ content area is optionally surrounded by padding, border and margin. When you set height and width of an element, you set content height and width.
