Answer:

`inline`, elements do not break the flow. think of span it fits in the line. Important points about inline elements, margin/ padding will push other elements horizontally not vertically. Moreover, inline elements ignores height and width.

`block`, breaks the flow and dont sits inline. they are usually container like div, section, ul and also text p, h1, etc.

`inline-block`, will be similar to inline and will go with the flow of the page. Only differences is this this will take height and width.
