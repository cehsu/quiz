Answer: repaint happens when you change the look of an element without changing the size and shape. This doesn't cause reflow as geometry of the element didn't changed.

How it happens:

change background color
change text color
visibility hidden

In the image below, only the painting and display part is changes due to repaint. Browser doesn't have to change the render tree or layout of the page. Hence, this is less expensive than reflow.

If possible, prefer repaint over reflow.
