Answer: @import allows you to load/ import stylesheet by using a path (uri) representing the location of the file. You can define one or more media by comma separation for which you want to load the stylesheet. If browser dont support the media stylesheet will not be loaded.

ref: be careful while using @import ([don't use @import](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/))
