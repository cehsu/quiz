Answer: You can leverage, event bubble to capture all the clicks. As all the clicks will be bubbled up to the body.

{% highlight javascript %}
document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function(e){
  console.log('body clicked', e.target);
});

//or
window.onclick =function(e){
  console.log('someone clicked', e.target)
}
{% endhighlight %}          
However, if event bubbling is canceled by `stopPropagation()` your code will not work. Think about it.
