title: "Are css properties case sensitive? Why css selectors mixed up with cases don't apply the styles? Does margin-top or margin-bottom has effect on inline element? Does padding-top or padding-bottom has effect on inline element? Does padding-left or padding-right or margin-left or margin-right has effect on inline element? If you have a `<p>` element with font-size: 10rem, will the text be responsive when the user resizes / drags the browser window? The pseudo class :checked will select inputs with type radio or checkbox, but not `<option>` elements. In a HTML document, the pseudo class :root always refers to the `<html>` element. The translate() function can move the position of an element on the z-axis."
