title: "How come, I can't use forEach or similar array methods on a NodeList?"

Answer: Yeah. Both array and nodeList have length and you can loop through elements but they are not same object.

Both are inherited from Object. However array has different prototype object than nodeList. forEach, map, etc are on array.prototype which doesn't exist in the NodeList.prototype object. Hence, you don't have forEach on a nodeList

{% highlight javascript %}
myArray --> Array.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null

myNodeList --> NodeList.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null
{% endhighlight %}      
Question: How could you solve this problem?

Answer: To solve this problem, you can simply loop through a nodeList and do whatever you wanted to inside forEach or you can call method on array to convert nodelist to an array. After that you will have access to all array.prototype methods

{% highlight javascript %}
var myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll('.my-class');
var nodesArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(myNodeList);

//use array method on nodeList
nodesArray.forEach(function(el, idx){
  console.log(idx, el);
});
{% endhighlight %}
