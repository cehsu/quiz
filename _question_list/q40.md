text-align: centerwill do the horizontal alignment but vertical-align: middle will not work here. there are couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are positioning. You make the parent as relative position and child as absolute positioning. And then define all position parameter as sero and width 50% and height 30% (sounds messy look at the example and read ref)
