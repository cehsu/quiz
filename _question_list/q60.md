Explanation:

function declaration `function a(){}` is hoisted first and it behaves like `var a = function () {};`. Hence in local scope variable `a` is created.
If you have two variables with same name (one in global another in local), local variable always get precedence over global variable.
When you set `a = 10;`, you are setting the local variable `a` , not the global one. Hence, the value of global variable remain same and you get, 1 in the log. ref: js hoisting/scope
Extra: If you didnt have a function named as "a", you will see 10 in the log.
