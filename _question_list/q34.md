Answer: `display: none` removes the element from the normal layout flow and allow other elements to fill in. `visibility: hidden` tag is rendered, it takes space in the normal flow but doesn't show it.

if u want to say it smartly, `display: none` causes DOM reflow where is `visibility: hidden` doesn't. btw, what is re-flow? answer. sorry i wont tell you, google it.
