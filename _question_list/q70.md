Answer: `window.onload` is fired when DOM is ready and all the contents including images, css, scripts, sub-frames, etc. finished loaded. This means everything is loaded.

`document.onload` is fired when DOM (DOM tree built from markup code within the document)is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.

Think about the differences between `window` and `document`, this would be easier for you.

Bonus: `document.readyState` Returns "loading" while the Document is loading, "interactive" once it is finished parsing but still loading sub-resources, and "complete" once it has loaded. The `readystatechange` event fires on the Document object when this value changes.
