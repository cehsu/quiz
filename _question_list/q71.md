Answer: attributes are just like attribute in your html tag (XML style attribute) inside the starting tag. html attributes are exposed to the DOM via property. Hence, a property is created when DOM is parsed for each attribute in the html tag. If you change an attribute only the value of the property will change. However, the value of attribute will remain same.
