HTTP/2 provides decreased latency to improve page load speed by supporting:

-Data compression of HTTP headers
-Server push technologies
-Loading of page elements in parallel over a single TCP connection
-Prioritization of requests

An important operational benefit of HTTP/2 is that it avoids the head-of-line blocking problem in HTTP 1.
