Answer: When you have multiple images/ icons, browser makes separate call to the server for each one of them. sprite is a technique to combine all/ some of them (usually similar one in terms of type of image. For example, you will put jpg in one sprite) in one image. To display the icon you set height, width and background position.

popular libraries like bootstrap use this technique. If you repeat the image. want to scale you have to be careful with sprite.
