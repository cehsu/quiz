Answer: pseudo class tells you specific state of an element. allow to style element dynamically. The most popular one is `:hover`. Besides i have used `:visited`, `:focus`, `:nth-child`, `nth-of-type`, `:link`, etc.

pseudo classes is better if you don't want to mess up with javaScript however, pseudo-classes is slow to process and apply rules.

pseudo elements

pseudo elements helps you to add cosmetics contents. pseudo elements generates content where as pseudo class deals with state of the element. for example, you can style `:first-letter` of every paragraph. similarly, `:first-line` and fancy stuff with `:before`, `:after`

{% highlight html %}

<style>
   p:before{
     content: "Starting of Paragraph: ";
     font-weight: bolder;
     color: purple;
   }
</style>
<p>First Paragraph with some content.</p>
<p>Second Paragraph with something else.</p>

{% endhighlight %}
