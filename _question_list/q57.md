title: "How could you use Math.max to find the max value in an array?"

Answer: Use apply on Math.max and pass the array as apply takes an array of arguments. Since we are not reading anything from this or using it at all. We can simply pass null as first parameter.

{% highlight javascript %}
function getMax(arr){
  return Math.max.apply(null, arr);  
}
{% endhighlight %}
        
Extra: call and apply, both takes the value of this as first parameter. However, call takes a collection of arguments after first parameter whereas apply use an array of arguments as second parameter.

Tip: If you have weaker memory like me, you can remember apply starts with "a" and array starts with "a"
