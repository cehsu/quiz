Answer: I have to declare a method on the prototype of Date object. To get access to the current value of the instance of the date, i will use `this`

{% highlight javascript %}
Date.prototype.nextDay = function(){
  var currentDate = this.getDate();
  return new Date(this.setDate(currentDate +1));
}

var date = new Date(); 
date; //Fri May 16 2014 20:47:14 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)
date.nextDay();//Sat May 17 2014 20:47:14 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)
        
{% endhighlight %}
