Number of concurrent HTTP requests and XmlHttpRequest is limited in all browsers. Specific limitations are different depending on browser type and version.

For example, according to Mozilla Developer Network Firefox 3 limits the number of XMLHttpRequest connections per server to 6 (previous versions limit this to 2 per server).

Having this mind, the number of concurrent HTTP requests created in this loop would never (by default) be larger than 6, and the browser would therefore execute this loop in chunks.
