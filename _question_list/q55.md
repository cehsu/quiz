Answer: There are at least three different ways to doing this by using bind, call and apply. For example, I have a method named deductMontlyFee in the object monica and by default value of this would be monica inside the method.

{% highlight javascript %}
var monica = {
  name: 'Monica Geller',
  total: 400,
  deductMontlyFee: function(fee){
     this.total = this.total - fee;
     return this.name + ' remaining balance is '+ this.total; 
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}       

If I bind the deductMontlyFee of monica with another object `rachel` and pass rachel as first parameter of the bind function, rachel would be the value of `this`.

{% highlight javascript %}
var rachel = {name: 'Rachel Green', total: 1500};
var rachelFeeDeductor = monica.deductMonthlyFee.bind(rachel, 200);

rachelFeeDeductor(); //"Rachel Green remaining balance is 1300"
rachelFeeDeductor(); //"Rachel Green remaining balance is 1100"
{% endhighlight %}
        
`bind` allows you to borrow a method and set the value of `this` without calling the function. It simply returns an exact copy of the function with new value of `this`. You can reuse the same function with new value of this without harming the old one.

{% highlight javascript %}
var ross = {name:'Ross Geller', total:250};
var rossFeeDeductor = monica.deductMonthlyFee.bind(ross, 25);
rossFeeDeductor(); //"Ross Geller remaining balance is 225"
rossFeeDeductor(); //"Ross Geller remaining balance is 200"

rachelFeeDeductor(); //"Rachel Green remaining balance is 900"
{% endhighlight %}
        
Follow up Question: If an older browser dont have bind function, how will you shim it

Answer: Look at the code below and use your brain.

{% highlight javascript %}
Function.prototype.bind = Function.prototype.bind || function(context){
  var self = this;
  return function(){
    return self.apply(context, arguments);
  };
}
{% endhighlight %}
