Answer: Aha... so many questions at the same time. Take a breathe Mr. Interviewer.

reflow: When you change size or position of an element in the page, all the elements after it has to change their position according to the changes you made. For example, if you change height on an element, all the elements under it has to move down in the page to accomodate a change in height. Hence, flow of the elements in the page is changed and this is called reflow.

Why reflow is bad: Reflows could be very expensive and it might have a performance hit specially in the smaller devices like phone. As it might causes changes in the portion (or whole) layout of the page.

Hide more explanation
In the images below, effect of reflow is shown in a yellow box. Reflow causes changes in the render tree which changes the layout of the page. Eventually browser has to paint the changes so that you can see your awesome changes.
