Answer: It depends on what you are selecting. If you have an ID of an element `getElmentById` is the fastest way to select an element. However, you should not have so many ID in you document to avoid style repetition. css class `getElementsByClassName` is the second quickest way to select an element

Here is the list. As we go downwards through the list, it takes more time to select elements.

-ID (#myID)
-Class (.myClass)
-Tag (div, p)
-Sibling (div+p, div~p)
-child (div>p)
-Descendant (div p)
-Universal (*)
-Attribute (input[type="checkbox"])
-Pseudo (p:first-child)

If you have crazy long selectors to select element, think about your selectors and check whether you can use a class instead.
