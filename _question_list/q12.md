MIME is an acronym for **M**ulti-purpose **I**nternet **M**ail **E**xtensions. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.

Web servers and browsers have a defined list of MIME types, which facilitates transfer of files of a known type, irrespective of operating system or browser.

A MIME type actually has two parts: a *type* and a *subtype* that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the MIME type for Microsoft Word files is {% highlight html %}application/msword{% endhighlight %} (i.e., type is {% highlight html %}application{% endhighlight %} and the subtype is {% highlight html %}msword{% endhighlight %}).
