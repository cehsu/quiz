doctype is an instruction to the browser to inform about the version of html document and how browser should render it.

It ensures how element should be displayed on the page by most of the browser. And it also makes browser's life easier. otherwise, browser will guess and will go to [quirks mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode). Moreover, doctype is required to [validate markup](https://validator.w3.org/).

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
{% endhighlight %} 

extra: this the first tag of html file, don't need a closing tag and not case sensitive.
