Answer: If you clear a slide of an element, floating elements will not be accepted on that side. With 'clear' set to 'left', an element will be moved below any floating element on the left side. clear is used to stop wrap of an element around a floating element.

show example

if you set, 'float: left;' for an image, it will move to the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level element is reached. The normal flow will wrap around on the right side.

{% highlight html %}
 <style>
   .clearLeft{
      clear: left;
   }
 </style>
 <div class="container">
    <div class="box"><span>1</span></div>
    <div class="box clearLeft"><span>2</span></div>
    <div class="box"><span>3</span></div>
    <div class="box"><span>4</span></div>
    <div class="box"><span>5</span></div>
  </div> 
{% endhighlight %}  

as clear left is applied to the second box. no other elements would be on the left of that box and hence it is placed in a new row.
