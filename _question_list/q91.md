Class Inheritance: instances inherit from classes (like a blueprint — a description of the class), and create sub-class relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the `new` keyword. Class inheritance may or may not use the `class` keyword from ES6.

Prototypal Inheritance: instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance.i

Good to hear:
-Classes: create tight coupling or hierarchies/taxonomies.
-Prototypes: mentions of concatenative inheritance, prototype delegation, functional inheritance, object composition.

Red Flags:
-No preference for prototypal inheritance & composition over class inheritance.
