Answer: This is very open and depend on what you are trying to achieve. If i order selectors in terms of render speed it would be like id, class, tag, siblings, child, descendant, universal, attribute, pseudo. Speed of ID and class is very close. However your code should be readable, maintainable and DRY along with highly performant.

The best practices in general are: avoid universal selectors, don't repeat yourself, remove redundant selectors, be as specific as possible, and keep learning.
